# DCGAN

Generating facial images of imaginary celebrities and facial sketches of imaginary people using Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). Used the CelebA and CUFS datasets to train the respective models.



* Few Instructions:
 * Create folders 'cufs' and 'celeba' at the master root and create subfolders called 'imgs' in each of them. Download the CelebA dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and the CUFS dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html) and put them into the 'imgs' subfolder of the respective folder. 
 * Change the "dataroot" global variable in each cell of main.ipynb from '../../GAN2/cufs/', '../../GAN2/celeba/' and '../../GAN2/cufs/' to 'cufs/', 'celeba/' and 'cufs/' respectively.
