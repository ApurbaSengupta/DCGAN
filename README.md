# DCGAN

Generating facial images of imaginary celebrities and facial sketches of imaginary people using Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). Used the CelebA and CUFS datasets to train the respective models.


Please note:
 * Before running the notebook, download the CelebA dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and the CUFS dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html) and put them into the 'imgs' subfolder of 'celeba' and 'cufs' respectively.
